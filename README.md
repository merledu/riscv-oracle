# RISC-V Oracle

RISC-V Oracle is a project aimed at developing a comprehensive tool for answering questions and providing assistance related to the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). Leveraging the power of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art language model, this tool will be trained with the latest RISC-V specifications, technical documents, and community discussions to ensure accurate and up-to-date responses.

## Project Description

The RISC-V ecosystem is rapidly evolving, with developers and enthusiasts worldwide contributing to its growth. However, navigating this vast sea of information can sometimes be overwhelming, leading to confusion and roadblocks. RISC-V Oracle aims to mitigate this issue by serving as an accessible, reliable, and knowledgeable resource on all things RISC-V.

RISC-V Oracle plans to utilize GPT-4, a transformer-based language model developed by OpenAI, known for its remarkable language understanding capabilities. The model will be fine-tuned on a carefully curated dataset comprised of the latest RISC-V specifications, technical documents, forums discussions, and more. This process will equip the model with an extensive knowledge of RISC-V, enabling it to provide detailed responses to user queries.

In addition to the AI model, the project also includes the development of an intuitive user interface that allows users to interact with the model easily. This interface will be designed keeping in mind the needs of different types of users, from developers looking for technical insights to beginners seeking basic understanding of the RISC-V ISA.

As a tool built for the community, RISC-V Oracle will be open-source, inviting contributions from developers across the globe. This approach will ensure the continuous improvement of the tool, keeping it in sync with the evolving RISC-V ecosystem.
